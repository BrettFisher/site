            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello! As you can probably tell, my name is Brett!</p>
            <p>Where am I from you ask? Born in Georgia, raised in Tennessee, currently residing in State College, PA.
               Oh, and my parents live in Virginia. Did you get all of that?</p>
            <p>I am passionate about learning new things, especially regarding development and software.
               Being the son of a football coach, I love sports. Soccer, football, and baseball to be exact.
               I listen to loads of music and I have played the drums for around 10 years. I am also very
               passionate about my faith.</p>
            <p>I love to reflect and have deep conversations with people in my life. I'm excited
               to see where my career takes me after college. If you're interested in learning a little bit
               more about me, be sure to check out my resume below.</p>

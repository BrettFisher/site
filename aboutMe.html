							<p>i am currently a junior at penn state university. i consider myself a thinker who loves to be creative. i enjoy learning new things and i love working with technology. i am a student manager on the football team and i absolutely love my job. i work with 12 other managers for over 40 hours a week during the season. i was born in georgia and raised in tennessee but right now my parents live in virginia.</p>

							<p>i've played the drums for about 10 years now and i love soccer (playing and watching). i am a huge consumer of music and i love to find new bands that i haven't heard of. i have one brother who currently lives in alabama.</p>

							<p>i have a variety of dreams and aspirations. my main goal is to work in the tech industry in software development. i enjoy web development and it is a budding interest of mine (this site being my first go at it). i also would love to be a soccer coach at one point and maybe work for lego.</p>

						<p>everything happens for a reason...or so i've heard. that's not what i wanted to hear, though. especially now that my entire life was ruined! you're probably wondering what i'm talking about. the situation i'm referring to is my senior year of high school and given that this is my first blog entry i want to give you some background about myself.</p> 

						<p>hmmm...well, before i talk about where i am now, namely how i became an IST student here at penn state, let's talk about where it all started. i was born in georgia and raised in tennessee. you could call me a southern boy. i like a little tea with my sugar and chikfila breakfast is the closest thing you'll find to heaven on earth (seriously, try it if you haven't). my dad has been a college football coach for over 30 years now and my mother takes care of the domestic side of things. they live in richmond, virginia. i have one brother who is 26 years old. he lives in birmingham, alabama. all of my family calls central pennsylvania home except for my brother and i. we lived in tennessee for 10 years so to us that is home. i'm very proud to have been raised in the south and hopefully one day i'll live there again.</p>

						<p>see, all of that is important because my dad's job has significantly affected my life. it's dictated where i have lived, the schools i have attended, the people i've been priveledged to meet, the places i've been, and the opportunities that have found their way into my story. as i look back on my life i find it absolutely amazing how everything has worked out and fit itself into its own place. often i am reminded of how blessed i am to have the father that i do simply because i'll get comments like "how's your pops doing?? tell him i said hello." or something along those lines. i think it's telling that i get that a lot. "always treat people right. they won't remember what you won or how much stuff you had, but they will remember how you made them feel.", he always tells me. i suppose my dad is a man of his word...</p>
